## 2. Comparable Analysis

### Dataset: 28 Token Launches with FDV Day 1

| Token | Raised | FDV Day 1 | Multiplier | Category |
|-------|--------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Monad | $513M | $2.5B | 4.9x | L1 |
| **zkSync** | **$458M** | **$1.47B** | **3.2x** | **L2** |
| Aptos | $350M | $8.5B | 24.3x | L1 |
| Sui | $336M | $12.5B | 37.2x | L1 |
| Starknet | $282M | $20.0B | 70.9x | L2 |
| LayerZero | $263M | $6.8B | 25.9x | Infra |
| Wormhole | $225M | $13.0B | 57.8x | Infra |
| Optimism | $178M | $19.0B | 106.4x | L2 |
| EigenLayer | $164M | $5.5B | 33.4x | Infra |
| Berachain | $142M | $4.2B | 29.9x | L1 |
| Arbitrum | $124M | $12.5B | 101.1x | L2 |
| Manta Network | $60M | $3.5B | 57.9x | L2 |
| Celestia | $55M | $6.2B | 112.7x | L1 |
| Scroll | $50M | $1.5B | 30.0x | L2 |
| ether.fi | $50M | $3.0B | 60.0x | DeFi |

### Key Pattern Discovered

```
Higher Raises = Lower Multipliers

Raised >$400M:    3-5x multiplier (zkSync, Monad)
Raised $100-400M: 25-70x multiplier
Raised <$100M:    50-200x multiplier
```

**Why?** Large raises mean investors already captured upside. Less room for day-1 pump.

---

## 3. Prediction Methodology

### Method 1: Direct Comparable (zkSync)

```
zkSync:   $458M raised -> $1.47B FDV (3.2x)
MegaETH:  $506M raised -> ???

Formula: (MegaETH / zkSync) x zkSync_FDV
         ($506M / $458M) x $1.47B = $1.63B
```

**Result: $1.63B** (Conservative base case)

---

### Method 2: Hype Adjustment

```
Base:           $1.63B
Hype Factor:    x1.5
Result:         $2.44B
```

**Hype Factors (x1.5):**
- Vitalik Buterin personal investment (legitimacy signal)
- "100k TPS real-time blockchain" narrative
- Dragonfly lead (Aptos, Cosmos track record)

---

### Method 3: Demand Adjustment

```
Base:           $2.44B
Demand Factor:  x1.3
Result:         $3.17B
```

**Demand Signal:**
- Public sale: $450M raised
- Total bids: $1.39B
- **Oversubscription: 27.8x**

This is direct market signal of willingness to pay.

- **Liquidity Risk** - Polymarket orderbook depth
- **Delayed Launch** - Timeline uncertainty

### Upside Risks
- **Vitalik Effect** - Personal endorsement may drive retail FOMO
- **Technical Breakthrough** - 100k TPS proven could exceed expectations
- **Market Recovery** - Fear turning to Greed would boost multiplier
